# Simple-interactive-animation
A simple interactive animation with Processing using a model view controller design

This model consists of multiple object types all inheriting from a single base class. 
Each object type will execute a shared behaviour a little bit differently: 
  they will all move a bit differently around the screen, and when the mouse is clicked,
  they will all react in a different way
